Please note that all of the performance audits are run from the same server. This means that while the carbon value may not be truly representative due to the limitations in our analysis based on the time constraints of a hack, the error between audits of sites is systematic and consistent. Future iterations of Digital Footprint can improve the complexity of the analysis used to generate these scores to form more accurate comparisons.
